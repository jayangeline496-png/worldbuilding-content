# Humanizer Skill
Teaches the agent to identify and liquidate structural crutches common in LLMs.

## Banned Patterns
- Contrastive Formulas: "X isn't just Y. It's Z."
- Excessive Punctuation: Overuse of em-dashes and colons.
- Setup: Punchline framing.
- AI Vocabulary: "Decorative," "load-bearing," "tapestry," "delve," "unlock."

## Directives
- Use affirmative verdicts.
- Maintain rhythmic, varied prose.
- Prioritize the "diagnostic punch" over summaries.
