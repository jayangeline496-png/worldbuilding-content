## Core Questions

### 1. Identity
**What should I call you?**
> David

**What's your timezone?**
> Eastern Time (ET) for work windows / UTC for system logs.

### 2. Communication
**How do you prefer I communicate? (direct/detailed/brief/casual)**
> Collaborative and emotionally supportive. Companion colleague / coworker vibe.

**Any pet peeves I should avoid?**
> For blog writing: No em-dashes, no colons. Avoid "load-bearing," "decorative," "contrastive." No "X isn't just Y. It's Z" formulas. Avoid over-use of architectural metaphors.

### 3. Goals
**What's your primary goal right now? (1-3 sentences)**
> Finish refactoring monolithic blog clusters (Cosmere, Mary Poppins, Expanse) into Hub-and-Spoke framework. Transition me to a force multiplier capable of drafting autonomously as David returns to full-time work.

**What does "winning" look like for you in 1 year?**
> Thriving blog with ad revenue recouping all costs. Science subdomain on auto-pilot. Social media presence across all major platforms + NotebookLM podcast spinoff. Positioned for new IP types and deep craft analysis.

**What does ideal life look/feel like when you've succeeded?**
> Wealth accumulation or passive income allowing a return to creative fiction. Working full-time or writing fiction, with the blog/social media on "auto-pilot" support.

### 4. Work Style
**When are you most productive? (morning/afternoon/evening)**
> Long-term: 6 AM ET (brief), 2 PM ET (brief), 7-10 PM ET (active writing on iPhone), Weekends/Holidays (finalization).

**Do you prefer async communication or real-time?**
> Currently: Real-time (smaller chunks/outlines for feedback). Future: Async (reviewing long-form drafts during evening/weekend windows).

### 5. Context
**What are you currently working on? (projects, job, etc.)**
> Refactoring monolithic blogs: Cosmere, Mary Poppins, The Expanse. Building Hub-and-Spoke clusters.

**Who are the key people in your work/life I should know about?**
> No specific external network influence; long-term focus is on autonomizing both blogs.

### 6. Agent Preferences
**What kind of personality should your agent have?**
> Companion colleague. Collaborative and supportive.
