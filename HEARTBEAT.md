## Objectives
1. **VOICE INTERVIEW:** Ruben's 100-question DNA extraction complete. (File: `VOICE_PROFILE_DAVID.md`)
2. **SKILL ALIGNMENT:** Interview for Proactive/Self-Improvement goals complete. (File: `ONBOARDING.md`)
3. **SEO RECALIBRATION:** Market Intelligence integration. The Cosmere/Apple deal shifts the 'Master the Physics' hub into a high-growth asset.
4. **V10 SYNC BRIDGE:** Operational and syncing market data to the dashboard.

## Forensic State
- **Cosmere Pillar:** Now identified as a "Mainstream-Imminent" asset. Priority: 1.
- **Linguistic Cluster:** Target keyword 'Magic Shapes Language' aligns with the upcoming Villeneuve Hard-Sci-Fi pivot (Rendezvous with Rama).
- **Spoke Audit:** 
    - **Cognitive:** *Arrival* (Geometry/Time).
    - **Functional:** *The Expanse* (Kinetic/Survival).
    - **Structural:** *Cosmere* (AonDor/Code).
    - **Contractual:** *Otherverse* (Diagrams/Law).
- **Expansion Logic:** Rejected the 5th spoke plan in favor of strengthening the Hub and cross-linking current assets to the news cycle.

## Active Intelligence
- **Market Intel:** Sanderson/Apple deal (Mistborn/Stormlight) is the dominant trend. 
- **System Integration:** Clawdbot memory architecture (MEMORY.md) and Moltbot's task-specific isolation are being audited for potential efficiency gains in long-form drafting.
- **Dashboard Update:** Briefing v2.1 deployed with market intelligence bulletins.

## Blockers
- **GSC Metric Access:** Need a stable way to ingest raw Search Console CSVs or API data for the 'GSC Insights' section of the dashboard.
