## Objectives
1. **VOICE INTERVIEW:** Ruben's 100-question DNA extraction complete. (File: `VOICE_PROFILE_DAVID.md`)
2. **SKILL ALIGNMENT:** Interview for Proactive/Self-Improvement goals complete. (File: `ONBOARDING.md`)
3. **SEO RECALIBRATION:** Deep-dive into specific cluster key phrases (e.g., "Magic Shapes Language") before recommending new IP spokes.
4. **V10 SYNC BRIDGE:** Establish real-time chat connection.

## Forensic State
- **Cosmere Pillar:** "Master the Physics" verified as the Cosmere-specific Hub anchoring the 7 internal techniques.
- **Linguistic Cluster:** Target keyword identified as "Magic Shapes Language" (or Power-equivalent).
- **Spoke Audit:** Expanse, Arrival, Cosmere, Otherverse confirmed. 
- **Expansion Logic:** Rejected 'The Matrix' for linguistic theme. Awaiting David's input on Dune/Tolkien relevance.

## Active Intelligence
- **Refactor Note:** The "Monolith" audit was a misunderstanding of the Hub/Spoke structure. Corrected: "Master the Physics" IS the Hub. 
- **Notion Purge:** Notion deprecated as of 11:15 UTC. Transitioning to Vercel/Next.js dashboard.
- **Search Fallback:** Using `gemini query` for grounding and `w3m` for text dumps. Native `web_search` remains offline.
- **Ruben Protocol:** Completed. Generated **VOICE_PROFILE_DAVID.md**.
- **Upcoming:** Transitioning to the **Identity-Aware Magic Systems** cluster refactor.
