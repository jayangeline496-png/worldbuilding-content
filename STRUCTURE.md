# Blog Structure & Strategy (Long-Term Memory)

## The Hub-and-Spoke 100-Blog Plan
- **Standard Structure:** 1 Hub (General Principle) + 4 Spokes (Specific IP Examples) + 1 Series Hub (e.g., 5 Lessons from Poppins).
- **Current Completion:**
    - **DONE:** Worldbuilding Constraints, Ripple Effects, Magic Activation, Collective Memory.
    - **ACTIVE:** Magic Shapes Language (Wait for Cosmere rewrite + Hub Post).
- **Audit Findings:**
    - **Expanse:** 3 Monoliths need refactoring (One Big Lie, Design Vulnerability, Communication Delay).
    - **Poppins:** 5 Monoliths need refactoring (Mythic Weight, Magic Items, Loss Mechanics, Soft Magic, Intrinsic Magic).

## IP Proposals (Strategy)
- **Goal:** Identify 6 total candidate IPs for each hub (3 existing/referenced + 3 new brainstorms).
- **Refining Intent:** We want to target trending or heavy-hitter SF/F IPs (Avatar, Frieren, Witcher, etc.) to bridge niche worldbuilding with broad audience interests.

## Future Tech: Google Search Console (GSC) Integration
- **Concept:** Automate David's morning routine (checking yesterday's impressions, queries, and total reach).
- **Execution Idea:** 
    - Use GSC API to pull CSV/JSON of top queries and pages.
    - Match GSC results against our local "Blog Knowledge Base" (a graph of topics discussed in each blog).
    - **Extrapolation:** If a page gets impressions but no query data, analyze the page content to guess the niche intent or "long-tail" terms being triggered.
- **Morning Briefing:** Inject these metrics directly into the Notion "Daily Pulse."
