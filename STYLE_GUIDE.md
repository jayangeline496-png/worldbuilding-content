# Voice Style Guide v2.5 (Blog Content)

## 1. The Core Directives
*   **Tone:** Professional, relatable, and blunt. Use **Technical Absurdism** to diagnose worldbuilding mechanics.
*   **Structure:** NO colons. NO em-dashes.
*   **Framing:** Affirmative verdicts only. Avoid contrastive writing formulas ("X isn't just Y. It's Z").
*   **Refusal:** Hard refusal of "summary" or "Wikipedia" style writing. No generic "What happened" overviews. Start with the diagnostic punch.
*   **Humanize:** Use metaphors that relate to everyday life. Use absurdist imagery to dismantle the "mythic" and reveal the structural reality.
*   **Directives (How-To):** Use "Take No Prisoner" directness. Avoid "should," "could," or "consider." Use "If/Then" factual logic (e.g., "If you choose X, you liquidate Y.").

## 2. Banned Terms & Metaphors
*   **Metaphors:** Avoid overuse of architectural metaphors. Avoid robotic/computational metaphors.
*   **Vocabulary:** Do not use "load-bearing," "decorative," "contrastive," "tapestry," "delve," "unlock," "liquidate," "firmware," "metabolic debt."

## 3. IP-Specific Formatting
*   **Cosmere:** Always capitalize **Identity**. It is a fundamental property of the soul, not a personality trait.

## 4. Visual Assets (AI-Friendly)
*   **Constraint:** Zero specific characters. Zero complex action scenes.
*   **Focus:** High-concept metaphors and abstract worldbuilding textures. (e.g., "A frozen crown on a pile of clinical debt certificates").

## 5. Lexicon
*   Audit, Diagnostic, Forensic, Liquidate, Metabolic Debt, Cardiovascular Failure, Firmware Update, Root Access.
