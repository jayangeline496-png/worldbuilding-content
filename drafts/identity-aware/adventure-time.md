# The Foreclosure of Simon Petrikov: Compound Interest on "Just This Once"

Simon Petrikov made the classic apocalypse mistake: he assumed "just this once" had an expiration date. 

The Crown came with ice powers and a complimentary personality disorder. Previous owner included. Non-negotiable. It wasn't a tool; it was a hostile takeover of his identity, and the installment plan was paid in memories. 

## 1. The Installment Plan of Erasure
Simon wore the Crown to save a child. He chose Marceline over himself, and the magic accepted his payments with enthusiasm. 

"Just this once" became a millennium-long subscription service. Every time he used the magic to fight radioactive bears, the Crown took a percentage of his selfhood. He documented his own murder in real-time, recording VHS tapes as he watched his doctorate and his fiancée get overwritten by a fetish for kidnapping princesses. 

The horror isn't the madness. It’s the math. Simon’s resistance was a finite resource; the Crown’s patience was infinite. It didn't possess him; it simply foreclosed on him when he ran out of "Simon" to pay the interest. 

## 2. The Mercury Poisoning of Immortality
Ice King has zero conscious memory of Simon Petrikov. That guy’s uninstalled. 

For 600 years, he was just a body being driven by corrupted cloud storage. He had a community, a routine, and a weird kind of manic joy because amnesia is a hell of a drug. Being Ice King meant ignorance was bliss and bliss was magically enforced. 

Then he found the tapes. 

Watching your own suicide note recorded by a version of you that doesn’t exist anymore isn’t a character arc. It’s an existential freefall. The Crown let him surface just long enough to realize he was missing, then dragged him back under. 

## 3. The Price of the Restoration
Betty time-traveled to save him and realized the return policy was brutal. Simon couldn't save himself, so she had to uninstall reality at the registry level by fusing with Primordial Chaos. 

It worked. Simon came back. 

But he came back to a world where his fiancée is a chaos god, his surrogate daughter is a vampire queen, and he has a Social Security check from a government that died while he was looking for princesses. 

Restoration isn't a happy ending. It’s a diagnosis of everything you missed while you were asleep. Simon is the only one left who remembers what the exchange rate actually was, and he’s not sure the math adds up.

### Common Questions About The Crown
**Q: Why didn't the Crown take Marceline?**  
A: Because she wasn't the target market. The Crown wants a specific configuration of ego to overwrite. Marceline was already a survivor; Simon was a donor. 

**Q: Can the "Simon" backup be restored without Betty?**  
A: No. The data is corrupted. You can't fix a thousand years of overwrite with a patch; you need a system wipe. Betty was the system wipe. 

**Q: Does Simon miss the Crown?**  
A: Yes. Every day. He misses the simplicity of not knowing who he failed.
