# The Foreclosure of Simon Petrikov: Why the Identity-Aware Magic System in Adventure Time Always Collects

Simon Petrikov made the classic apocalypse mistake: he assumed "just this once" had an expiration date. 

The Crown came with ice powers and a complimentary personality disorder. Previous owner included. Non-negotiable. It wasn't a tool; it was a hostile takeover of his identity, and the installment plan was paid in memories. In most fantasy, the [identity-aware magic system in Adventure Time](https://jayangeline.com/adventure-time/) would be treated as simple possession. In reality, it’s an erosive sentencing hearing that tracks the conversion rate of your humanity in real-time until the exact moment "not yet" became "already gone" happened three centuries ago and nobody noticed.

Congratulations, you just lost yourself to a piece of jewelry. Die mad about it.

## 1. The Installment Plan of Erasure
Simon wore the Crown to save a child. He chose Marceline over himself, and the magic accepted his payments with enthusiasm. "Just this once" became a millennium-long subscription service. Every time he used the magic to fight radioactive bears, the Crown took a percentage of his selfhood. 

He documented his own murder in real-time, recording VHS tapes as he watched his doctorate, his fiancée, and his basic social skills get overwritten by a fetish for kidnapping princesses. The horror isn't the madness; it’s the math. Simon’s resistance was a finite resource; the Crown’s patience was infinite. It didn't possess him; it simply foreclosed on him when he ran out of "Simon" to pay the interest. 

By the time he became the Ice King, the original tenant had vacated centuries ago and nobody noticed because the new tenant kept paying rent. The Crown didn't just delete his identity; it replaced it with a pre-packaged backup of Gunther Gunthorn, but with worse posture and a depressing habit of crying in frozen fortresses. 

## 2. The Mercury Poisoning of Immortality
Ice King has zero conscious memory of Simon Petrikov. That guy’s uninstalled. For 600 years, he was just a body being driven by corrupted cloud storage. He had a community, a routine, and a weird kind of manic joy because amnesia is a hell of a drug. Being Ice King meant ignorance was bliss and bliss was magically enforced by chronic identity failure. 

Then he found the tapes. Watching your own suicide note recorded by a version of you that doesn’t exist anymore isn’t a character arc; it’s an existential freefall. The Crown let him surface just long enough to realize he was missing, then dragged him back under. 

This is the cruelty of an identity-aware system that outlasts its wielder. It doesn't just change you; it preservation-kills you. It keeps your body operational as a museum exhibit for an owner who isn't coming back. Simon was historically ancient but physiologically preserved at the exact moment he started losing the war for his own mind. 

## 3. The Price of the Restoration
Betty time-traveled to save him and realized the return policy was brutal. Simon couldn't save himself, so she had to uninstall reality at the registry level by fusing with Primordial Chaos. It worked. Simon came back. But he came back to a world where his fiancée is a chaos god, his surrogate daughter is a thousand-year-old vampire queen, and he has a Social Security check from a government that died while he was looking for princesses. 

Restoration isn't a happy ending. It’s a diagnosis of everything you missed while you were asleep. Simon is the only one left who remembers what the exchange rate actually was, and he’s not sure the math adds up. Sometimes he misses the Crown. Not because he wants power, but because he misses the simplicity of not knowing who he failed.

The "happy ending" cost him everything that made his humanity worth reclaiming. He is now a man defined by the absence of the person who saved him, living in the wreckage of a life he spent a thousand years forgetting.

### Unique FAQ: The Ice Crown Audit
**Q: Why didn't the Crown take Marceline?**  
A: Because she wasn't the target market. The Crown wants a specific configuration of ego to overwrite. Marceline was already a survivor; Simon was a donor. 

**Q: Can the "Simon" backup be restored without Betty?**  
A: No. The data is corrupted. You can't fix a thousand years of overwrite with a patch; you need a system wipe. Betty was the system wipe. 

**Q: Does Simon miss the Crown?**  
A: Yes. Every day. He misses the simplicity of not knowing who he failed. It’s the survivor’s guilt of someone who survived their own execution.
