# The Foreclosure of Simon Petrikov: Why the Identity-Aware Magic System in Adventure Time Always Collects

Simon Petrikov made the classic apocalypse mistake: he assumed "just this once" had an expiration date. 

The Crown came with ice powers and a complimentary personality disorder. Previous owner included. Non-negotiable. It wasn't a tool; it was a hostile takeover of his identity, and the installment plan was paid in memories. In most fantasy, the [identity-aware magic system in Adventure Time](https://jayangeline.com/adventure-time/) would be treated as simple possession. In reality, it’s an erosive sentencing hearing that tracks the conversion rate of your humanity in real-time until the exact moment "not yet" became "already gone" happened three centuries ago and nobody noticed.

Congratulations, you just lost yourself to a piece of jewelry. Die mad about it.

## 1. The Installment Plan of Erasure
Simon wore the Crown to save a child. He chose Marceline over himself, and the magic accepted his payments with enthusiasm. "Just this once" became a millennium-long subscription service. Every time he used the magic to fight radioactive bears, the Crown took a percentage of his selfhood. 

He documented his own murder in real-time, recording VHS tapes as he watched his doctorate, his fiancée, and his basic social skills get overwritten by a fetish for kidnapping princesses. The horror isn't the madness; it’s the math. Simon’s resistance was a finite resource; the Crown’s patience was infinite. It didn't possess him; it simply foreclosed on him when he ran out of "Simon" to pay the interest. The community often asks if Simon is still "in there"—the answer is found in the corrupted cloud storage of the Crown’s memory.

## 2. The Mercury Poisoning of Immortality
Ice King has zero conscious memory of Simon Petrikov. That guy’s uninstalled. For 600 years, he was just a body being driven by corrupted cloud storage. He had a community, a routine, and a weird kind of manic joy because amnesia is a hell of a drug. Being Ice King meant ignorance was bliss and bliss was magically enforced by chronic identity failure. 

Then he found the tapes. Watching your own suicide note recorded by a version of you that doesn’t exist anymore isn’t a character arc; it’s an existential freefall. The Crown let him surface just long enough to realize he was missing, then dragged him back under. This is the biological cruelty of preservation: keeping the body operational while the soul is deleted bit by bit.

## 3. The Price of the Restoration
Betty time-traveled to save him and realized the return policy was brutal. Simon couldn't save himself, so she had to uninstall reality at the registry level by fusing with Primordial Chaos (Golb). It worked. Simon came back. 

But he came back to a world where his fiancée is a chaos god, his surrogate daughter is a thousand-year-old vampire queen, and he has a Social Security check from a government that died while he was looking for princesses. Restoration isn't a happy ending. It’s a diagnosis of everything you missed while you were asleep. Simon is the only one left who remembers what the exchange rate actually was, and he’s not sure the math adds up.

### Unique FAQ: The Ice Crown Audit
**Q: Is Simon's soul "in" the crown or was it deleted?**  
A: It was overwritten. The Crown uses the wielder's hardware to run its own software. There are fragments of Simon left in the "Corrupted Files" of the magic, but the primary user is Gunther's wish.

**Q: Does the Crown's wish-granting override Simon's nature?**  
A: Yes. The wish is the core directive. Simon’s nature was simply the medium the wish consumed to manifest itself.

**Q: Can the "Simon" backup be restored without Betty?**  
A: No. The data is too far gone. You can't fix a thousand years of overwrite with a simple patch; you need a system wipe. Betty was the only one willing to provide the wipe.
