## Content Strategy & Projects

### The Hub-and-Spoke Refactor
David is refactoring existing "monolith" blog posts into a more SEO-friendly and digestible structure.
- **Target:** ~100 blogs total before a major social media push.
- **Structure:** 5 posts per principle (1 Hub + 4 Spokes/IP examples).
- **Current Status:**
    - Completed Refactors (Hub + Spokes): Worldbuilding constraints, Ripple effects, Collective memory shaping reality, Magic activation systems, Master the Physics of Fantasy.
    - Active Project: "Magic Shapes Language" hub. 
        - Spokes written: Otherverse, Arrival, The Expanse (corporate power focus), Cosmere.
    - **Identity-Aware Magic Project:** 8 full long-form drafts completed and polished (Cosmere, Magnus, Adventure Time, Matrix, Green Lantern, Death Note, Bleach, Hub Post).
- **Backlog:**
    1. Refactor Mary Poppins series (6 existing blogs need 3 additional IPs each to hit the 5-post-per-principle structure).
    2. Finish The Expanse series (break published blogs into hubs/spokes).
    3. Finalize the "Magic Shapes Language" cluster (Deep-dive key phrases).

## Systems & Infrastructure
- **Vercel / Next.js Intelligence Dashboard:** (WIP) Moving away from Notion. David is building a native dashboard for tracking project velocity and intelligence.
- **GSC Integration:** Automated daily briefings pulling Google Search Console metrics (impressions/queries). 
- **Style Guide:** Strict persona constraints (No colons/em-dashes, affirmative framing, forensic tone).
- **Automation:** 6:00 AM Discord briefing ping (Previously tied to Notion, now transitioning to direct chat/app reporting).
