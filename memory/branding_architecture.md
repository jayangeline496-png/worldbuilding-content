# Branding & Domain Architecture (The Dual-Lens Strategy)

## 1. The Physics of Storytelling (Main Blog: jayangeline.com)
- **Primary Focus:** Worldbuilding mechanics, character autopsies, and structural diagnostics through a scientific lens.
- **Tone:** Forensic, analytical, and authoritative.
- **Color Palette:** **PURPLE** Core.
    - **ORANGE:** Content/Authority (Actual articles and deep-dives).
    - **PURPLE:** Announcements, Community, and Support.
- **Strategic Goal:** Position the primary brand as the technical authority on *how* stories are constructed.
- **Ad Revenue Targets:** 
    - AdSense: 50 PV daily.
    - Mediavine Journey: 333 sessions daily.
    - Full Mediavine: 1,667 sessions daily.
    - Raptive: 3,333 PV daily.
- **Monetization Milestone:** Recoup costs for hosting, Mac Mini, and AI subscriptions (~$400/yr).

## 2. Telling Physics Stories (Science Subdomain: science.jayangeline.com)
- **Primary Focus:** State-of-the-art science and technology (FTL, Nanotech, Bio-Sovereignty) presented through a narrative lens for creatives.
- **Tone:** Explanatory, narrative-driven, and technical.
- **Color Palette:** **ORANGE** Core.
    - **PURPLE:** Content/Authority (Technical deep-dives).
    - **ORANGE:** Announcements, Community, and Support.
- **Strategic Goal:** Build an "SEO Juice" engine that feeds technical search intent back into the worldbuilding IP clusters.

## 3. Symmetry & Inversion
The two domains act as mirrors. 
- **The Main Blog** asks: "What are the rules of this fictional world?" 
- **The Subdomain** asks: "What are the rules of the real world that make this fictional world possible?"
- **The Color Swap** ensures immediate visual recognition of which "lens" the reader is currently looking through.
