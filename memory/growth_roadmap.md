# Organic Growth Roadmap (Phase 1)

## 1. High-Precision Technical Interlinking
The blog's primary unique selling point (USP) is the "Scientific Parallel." We need to treat the scientific posts as the "Authority Pillar" and the Worldbuilding posts as the "Retention Spoke."
- **Action:** Every sci-fi worldbuilding post must link to a "First Principles" science post.
- **Goal:** Drive the reader from "I like this story" to "I learned why this story works," increasing time-on-site and domain authority.

## 2. Forensic Query Harvesting (The "Ghost" Strategy)
- **Action:** Weekly audit of "Ghost Impressions" (queries where we rank but don't have explicit keywords).
- **Goal:** Create 500-word "Micro-Posts" targeting these specific long-tail queries.

## 3. Rigorous Science Categorization (The "FTL" Prototype)
- **Action:** Instead of general science posts, build "Taxonomy Pillars."
- **Example Category: Faster-Than-Light (FTL)**
  - *Pillar:* The Physics of Causality (Why FTL is Time Travel).
  - *Spoke A:* Warp Drives vs. Alcubierre Metrics (The Hard Sci-Fi Lens).
  - *Spoke B:* Dimensional Folding & Jump Drives (The Fantasy Lens).
- **Goal:** Capture "Search Intent" for people looking for technical explanations of fiction tropes.

## 4. Notion Forensic Dashboard
- **Action:** Consolidate the Voice Guide, Blog Inventory, and GSC Forensic Audit into a single "Command Center" page.
- **Goal:** One-stop visibility for David to see exactly what is working and what is queued.
