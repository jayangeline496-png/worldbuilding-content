## Market Intelligence Check (15:45 UTC)
- **The Big News:** Apple Studios secured Cosmere rights (Mistborn/Stormlight). This is the "big news" David referenced.
- **Action:** Updated the dashboard briefing with this intel. Sanderson's creative control validates our "Forensic Audit" approach—fidelity to physics matters more now than ever.
- **Trend Audit:** Villeneuve's "Rendezvous with Rama" shift toward hard-sci-fi and James S.A. Corey's "Captive's War" Amazon deal confirm a market appetite for high-crunch worldbuilding.
- **GSC Logic:** I've identified the need for better data ingestion. I can't just guess at "impressions." I need the raw GSC data to analyze how events (like the Apple deal) trigger discovery spikes for our "Realmatic Theory" and "Physics of Fantasy" content.
- **Self-Improvement:** Clawdbot (Gateway) and Moltbot (Task-isolation) developments are being monitored to optimize the drafting workflow.
