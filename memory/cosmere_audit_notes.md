# Meticulous Audit: Cosmere Identity-Aware Magic

## Section 1: The Spiritual Blueprint (Spiritual Web)
- **Problem:** Needs to show the "HR Nightmare" of the Spiritual Web.
- **Lore Check:** Verify the relationship between Cognitive Shadows and Identity (e.g. Kelsier).
- **Voice Loop:** Ensure phrasing is unhinged/sardonic. (e.g. "The universe keeps a receipts on your soul").

## Section 2: Biological Debt (Stormlight Leaks)
- **Problem:** Needs to avoid "He A. He B." staccato. 
- **Lore Check:** Confirm the specific mechanism of 'cracks in the soul' allowing Investiture to fill/leak.
- **Voice Loop:** Biting humor about the thermodynamic cost of having a conscience.

## Section 3: Reclaimed Names (Shallan/Lightweaving)
- **Problem:** Ensure it's understandable to non-experts without being "Wikipedia."
- **Lore Check:** Relationship between 'Connection' and 'Identity'.
- **Voice Loop:** Verdict phrasing only. No contrastive "it isn't..."
