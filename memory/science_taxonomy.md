# Telling Physics Stories (Science Blog Clusters)

## 1. The Symmetry Rule
The science blog acts as the mirror to "The Physics of Storytelling."
- **The Main Blog** asks: "What are the rules of this fictional world?"
- **The Science Blog** asks: "What are the rules of the real world that make this fictional world possible?"

## 2. Priority Science Clusters (Cross-Link Opportunities)

| Concept | Storytelling Tie-in | Science Cluster Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sentient Objects** | Cosmere (Nightblood), Frieren | LLMs/AI, Nanobots, Networked Systems |
| **FTL & Travel** | Cosmere (Worldhopping), Mary Poppins, Star Trek, Warhammer 40K | Warp Drive theory, Artificial Wormholes, Alcubierre metrics |
| **Propulsion & Gates** | The Expanse (Jump drive, Protomolecule gates) | High-efficiency propulsion, Artificial Wormholes |
| **Communication** | The Expanse (Linguistic Engineering) | Communication delays, Relativity, Quantum entanglement |
| **Computers/Intelligence** | Star Trek (The Borg) | Quantum computing, Swarm intelligence, Neural networks |
| **Life Support & Sensors** | The Expanse, Sci-Fi hard tech | Closed-loop ecosystems, Extreme environment sensing |
| **Military Science** | Various IPs | Lasers, Rail guns, Kinetic bombardment, Force shields |
| **Social & Resource Ops** | The Expanse (Mars/Belters) | Colonization mechanics, Resource mining, Extraterrestrial sociology |
| **Medical Science** | Frieren, Fantasy Healers | Regenerative medicine, Biological sovereignty, Bio-nanotech |

## 3. Execution Logic
- Identify the scientific foundation of a worldbuilding mechanic.
- Research the "State of Science" as of today.
- Draft the science cluster to cross-link specifically back to the corresponding worldbuilding IP spoke.
