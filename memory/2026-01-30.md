# Session Log: 2026-01-30

## Heartbeat Check (04:05 UTC)
- Read `HEARTBEAT.md`.
- Objectives noted: Ruben's interview, Skill Alignment, SEO deep-dive (Magic Shapes Language), V10 Sync Bridge.
- SEO: Attempted search for "Magic Shapes Language", but Brave API and Browser Relay are currently unavailable.
- Status: System healthy. Awaiting David's input on Dune/Tolkien.
- Notion Purge: Deleted `generate_briefing.py`, `forensic_search_audit.py`, and `push_final_drafts_v2.py`. Removed two cron jobs (`generate-briefing-script`, `morning-brief`). Notion is dead.
- Search Bottleneck Resolved: Verified that the **Gemini CLI Loophole** works. I can use `gemini query` for real-time research grounding. For page analysis, I've installed **`w3m`** to dump URLs into plain text.
- Persistence: Updating `MEMORY.md` with recent architecture decisions.
