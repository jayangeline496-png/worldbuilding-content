# SF/F Trend Report: February 2026

## 1. THE COSMERE: "WIND AND TRUTH" HYPE
- **Status:** Brandon Sanderson is releasing preview chapters for Stormlight Archive #5. 
- **Trending Discussion:** The community is obsessing over the "Contest of Champions" mechanics. 
- **Niche Question:** If Dalinar loses and becomes a Fused, does his *Identity* override Odium’s Voidlight or does the Voidlight overwrite his Identity?
- **Strategic Fit:** Perfect for an "Identity-Aware Magic" expansion. It explores what happens when a Shard tries to "recruit" a high-conviction individual.

## 2. THE SISTERHOOD: DUNE PROPHECY
- **Status:** The HBO series is concluding its first season.
- **Trending Discussion:** How the Bene Gesserit "Missionaria Protectiva" isn't just myth-building; it's a social engineering firmware update for whole planets.
- **Niche Question:** Is there a point where the "planted" identity of a messiah becomes the *only* identity, even to the individual themselves?
- **Strategic Fit:** Ties into "One Big Lie" and "Identity Theft as Malware."

## 3. THE MURDERBOT DIARIES (MARTHA WELLS)
- **Status:** Resurgence in interest due to show announcements.
- **Trending Discussion:** The "SecUnit" identity—a being that actively resists its "owner-assigned" identity by consuming media.
- **Niche Question:** Can an AI have a "Spiritual Blueprint" in a world where magic exists? (Cross-over theory).
- **Strategic Fit:** This is the bridge between "Identity-Aware Magic" and our "Technical Clusters" (AI self-correction).

## 4. THE EXPANSE: CREATORS' NEW PROJECT
- **Status:** *The Mercy of Gods* (The Captive's War) is fueling discussion on "Biotech Imperialism."
- **Trending Discussion:** How alien ecosystems enforce their own "logic" on human prisoners.
- **Strategic Fit:** Great for "Ripple Effects" and "Communication Delay" (how captive populations develop their own Lang Belta equivalents under stress).

## 5. EMERGING TROPE: "FORENSIC FANTASY"
- **Status:** A rising "vibe" shift where fans prefer "autopsy-style" worldbuilding (why things break) over "power-fantasy" worldbuilding.
- **Note:** This *is* your niche. You are the "Jay Angeline" persona. 
- **Opportunity:** Focus on the "Thermal Exhaust Port" of magic systems—the design vulnerability that everyone ignores until it kills a billion people.
