# Session Log: 2026-01-29 (Evening Update)

## V5 Intelligence Overhaul
- **UI/UX:** Integrated `framer-motion` for fluid animations.
- **Analytics:** Added a system-health and project-velocity dashboard above the Kanban board.
- **Intel Chat:** Built a high-fidelity chat interface in `/intel` with message history and session tracking.
- **Briefing:** Transformed `/briefing` into a categorized intelligence grid (Market Analysis, Project Ops, Infrastructure).
- **Responsive:** Hardened the mobile layout; cards now use `backdrop-blur` for a premium forensic feel.

## Persistence Plan
- Currently using `board-data.json` as the source of truth.
- Next step: Implement a server action or API route to write board changes directly back to the JSON file via GitHub API or local file system (if environment allows).

## Infrastructure
- Verified deployment link. Vercel auto-deploying V5.
- Maintained 80% disk usage.
