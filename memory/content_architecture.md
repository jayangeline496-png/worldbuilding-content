# Content Architecture: The Cascading Pillar Strategy

## 1. The Iterative Sequence (3-IP Offset)
The blog will scale using a staggered "Maturity Model" for each IP. We don't just dump content; we exhaust a layer of analysis before moving to the next dimension of craft.

| Round | Focus: Worldbuilding | Focus: Character Analysis | Focus: Plot/Structure | Focus: Voice/Style |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Mary Poppins | - | - | - |
| **2** | The Expanse | - | - | - |
| **3** | The Cosmere | - | - | - |
| **4** | *New IP (Trending)* | **Mary Poppins** | - | - |
| **5** | *New IP (Choice)* | **Avatar / Frieren** | - | - |
| **6** | *New IP (Trending)* | **The Cosmere** | - | - |
| **7** | *New IP (Choice)* | **The Expanse** | **Mary Poppins** | - |
| **...** | ... | ... | ... | **Mary Poppins** |

## 2. Multi-Channel Distribution (The Blitz)
Social media is not just for traffic; it is for **Asset Repurposing**. 

*   **The Text Core:** X, Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon, Substack Notes. (Forensic verdicts and "Telling Physics Stories" snippets).
*   **The Visual Hook:** Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest. (Image-driven worldbuilding aesthetics and diagrams).
*   **The Audio/Deep-Dive:** Substack/Spotify (NotebookLM Podcasts), YouTube (Static Video + Effects).

## 3. Implementation Logic
- **Constraint:** We remain in the "Refactor Phase" until the 3 core worldbuilding clusters are hardened.
- **Workflow:** Every blog post now acts as a source file for the eventual NotebookLM podcast script.
- **Metric:** Success is defined by the depth of the "Cascading Pillar"—do readers follow Mary Poppins from her magic rules to her character archetypes?
